    <h2>Type Classes in Scala</h2>
    <p>
        This tutorial contains a few samples that details how type classes might be useful
        in Scala, as well as some tricks and tips you might not have seen before.
    </p>

    <p>
        Type classes are a particularly useful abstraction in languages that have mechanisms
        to support them. They are a way of adding behavior to standard data classes (like
        case class domain objects and collections, for example) without needing to alter
        those classes directly, instead implicitly (in Scala at least) providing definitions
        of a type class for the type you want to add the behavior to. This is sometimes called
        ad-hoc polymorphism and more detail on the theory can be found
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_class">on wikipedia</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are many good libraries already available for Scala that take advantage of
        type classes for this kind of usage. For example, the
        <a href="http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.1.1/ScalaJsonCombinators">Play
            Framework's own JSON support</a> makes use of type classes like Format, Reads and Writes
        to make it easy to convert to and from JSON. The real advantage of type-classes over
        more traditional approaches to this problem like reflection is that more issues (like
        missing conversions, for example) can be detected by the compiler rather than just
        resulting in errors at runtime.
    </p>

    <p>
        For these examples, we will be using <a href="https://github.com/spray/spray-json">Spray's
        JSON library</a> rather than the Play Framework's
        mainly because the Spray JSON library is smaller and written very clearly, with only
        one purpose in mind - to convert items to and from JSON with a minimum of effort.
        If you are already using Play on a project then the tips and tricks demonstrated here
        can easily be adapted. There is also an alternative implementation which demonstrates a
        simple (and limited) example of targeting XML rather than JSON for the output as well.
    </p>

    <p>Let's take a look at the code, move to the next page to continue the tutorial.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>JSON Savable Type Class (1)</h2>
    <p>
        Let's look at a type class definition, starting with the
        <a href="#code/src/main/scala/com/example/save/json/Savable.scala" class="shortcut">JSON
            Savable</a> first.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <code>Savable</code> defined in the json package is the definition of something that when provided,
        will give a String output for a given item input, in this case we will implement the
        string output to provide JSON for the item. First let's look at the <code>Savable</code>
        class at the top of this file.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <code>Savable</code> class is parameterized with a single generic type. This is part of
        the nature of a type class - it only makes sense to have one defined with a type parameter
        because when you extend it or otherwise implement it, you want to do so for a specific type
        so that it provides the extra functionality for that type.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <pre><code>abstract class Savable[RECORD <: Product : ClassManifest]</code></pre> definition has
        a fair amount going on in the type department so let's pull it apart. The first thing is that
        the generic is called <code>RECORD</code>. I used a longer name to make things clearer, but
        it's quite common to see individual letters used to represent type parameters (I think because
        programmers are lazy by nature :-) ).
    </p>
    <p>
        <pre><code>RECORD <: Product</code></pre> means that the RECORD parameter is bound to extend
        <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/#scala.Product">Product</a>. Bound in this
        case means that the Scala compiler enforces this constraint, and it means that you know
        any item of type RECORD will provide the methods defined on Product. Product is a
        trait that is mixed in to a number of Scala classes and implementation including Tuples
        and case classes, and it allows certain operations on the data inside those classes.
    </p>
    <p>
        <code><:</code> is known as an upper bound (it means that the RECORD generic is bound at the upper
        end by Product. I like to use mnemonics to read code and understand it, and since the bound has a
        "less than" operator in it, I read it as RECORD implements <em>at least</em> Product.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>JSON Savable Type Class (2)</h2>
    <p>
        There is another type bound on the generic, the <code>: ClassManifest</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>: T</code>
        is known as a context bound, and it means that there must be a type class for RECORD (in this case)
        that the compiler can see and use implicitly (or you may choose to fill it in explicitly if you
        like pain). <code>: ClassManifest</code> is the same as having an implicit parameter of type
        <code>ClassManifest[RECORD]</code>, like this:
        <pre><code>abstract class Savable[RECORD <: Product](implicit ev1: ClassManifest[RECORD])</code></pre>
        the context bound form is just shorthand for that implicit (but it also means it doesn't have
        a name, so we need to get that ClassManifest using the implicitly method:
        <pre><code>val ev1 = implicitly[ClassManifest[RECORD]]</code></pre> is an example of doing that,
        and assigns it to the same ev1 value as used in the implicit parameter example.
    </p>
    <p>
        Manifests, ClassManifests and ClassTags are type classes but they are also known by the Scala
        compiler and exhibit very useful behavior. When Scala sees a Manifest or Tag type class specified
        implicitly, it creates one for the type being passed in, so that you can get type information
        that can be used at runtime. Manifests are deep (i.e. for complex container types, they hold
        all of the information of the type parameters in the container type as well) while ClassTags are
        shallow (like just having the classOf[RECORD] information filled in by the compiler.
    </p>
    <p>
        The general rule of thumb is to use ClassTags (which are lighter and faster) unless you need the
        deep information of a Manifest. ClassManifest (used here) is actually deprecated, but right now
        the Spray JSON library still uses them, so I had to use them in this example. Typically use a
        ClassTag instead of a ClassManifest.
    </p>

</div>
<div>
    <h2>JSON Savable Type Class (3)</h2>
    <p>
        Within the definition of the abstract Savable class, we have a few interesting things as well:
    </p>
    <p>
        <pre><code>implicit val saveableAdapter: Savable[RECORD] = this</code></pre> bears some
        explanation. The Savable class, and it's subclasses Savable1..SavableN (also abstract) are
        designed to be extended by companion objects to classes. Implicits inside of the companion
        object for a class are automatically available to the compiler to be able to use to satisfy
        context bounds, so by setting an <code>implicit val</code>of type <code>Savable[RECORD]</code>
        and using a self reference <code>this</code> as the value, we make the companion object also
        satisfy the requirement for an implicit Savable within itself. It's a neat trick that works
        fairly well in practice and lets you define more streamlined type classes, as we will see
        in a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
        <pre><code>implicit val jsonFormat: JsonFormat[RECORD]</code></pre> is a pure abstract, and
        means that any implementing class must supply a JsonFormat type class for RECORD as a part of
        its implementation contract. These will be filled in by Savable1..Savable2, etc. and need to
        be a different implementation for each based on the arity of the class represented. Having this
        requirement in the Savable class means that any Savable also must have a JsonFormat defined for it,
        an implementation detail that is useful for our purposes. However if Savable meant something other
        than JSON (e.g. XML, SQL, etc.) then we could drop that requirement and add another. The point is
        that we have raised the abstraction level from a specific format or serialization to something that
        is simply "Savable".
    </p>
    <p>
        The final two lines just give us a handy string name for the RECORD based on its Manifest
        information, and a pretty toString for it so it's easy to spot in diagnostic messages, stack
        traces and so on.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Savable1, Savable2 .. SavableN Type Classes</h2>
    <p>
        Also supplied in <a href="#code/src/main/scala/com/example/save/json/Savable.scala"
          class="shortcut">Savable.scala</a> are the definitions of the
        <code>Savable1, Savable2, Savable3</code> and <code>Savable4</code> classes.
        For a real system these would probably go higher
        (all the way up to 22 is conventional), and are prime candidates for either some kind
        of code generation or macro generation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's take a look at <code>Savable2</code> to choose just one of them, the rest use the same
        principle other than the arity changing.
    </p>
    <p>
        <pre><code>abstract class Savable2[A : JsonFormat, B : JsonFormat,
    RECORD <: Product : ClassManifest] extends Savable[RECORD] {</code></pre> is the definition of
    the class. It is still abstract, since we don't want people creating new instance of this
    class directly. Instead it should be extended by a companion object, and ideally one for a
    <code>case class</code>. More on why in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
        Notice that this Savable2 has 3 type parameters, A, B and RECORD. RECORD is the type for
        which this is the companion (this might make more sense when you see the definition later).
        The other types, A and B are any types (they will actually need to agree with the types
        used for those field positions in the case class) and they have a context bound on them also
        which is that they must have a JsonFormat supplied as well. This kind of "recursive" context
        bounding is very useful for ensuring that all the types, all the way down, can be converted to
        JSON. If you remember, creating a Savable also means that a JsonFormat must be available for
        that type, so it means we can nest Savables into each other as well as other JsonFormat types
        (including types like Int, Double, String, Boolean, etc.)
    </p>
    <p>
        Notice also that each of the SavableNs extend Savable[RECORD] so that we can refer to just
        a generic Savable wherever we want to use it, rather than Savable2 or Savable3.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Implementation of Savable2</h2>
    <p>
        The body of Savable2 has two items defined in it:
        <pre><code>
def apply(f1: A, f2: B): RECORD
val jsonFormat: JsonFormat[RECORD] = jsonFormat2(this.apply)
        </code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        The first line states that we must have an <code>apply</code> method that takes two parameters,
        one of type A and one of type B. The definition of a <code>case class</code> is such that apply
        (and unapply) methods are created with suitable signatures. This means that if we extend Savable2
        in the companion object of a case class arity 2, we will satisfy that requirement. It also means
        you can use Savable2 for non-case classes, but if you do you will be required to supply a suitable
        apply method.
    </p>
    <p>
        The second line is the implementation of the JsonFormat for RECORD. Spray JSON supplies handy
        helper methods for anything that has a suitable apply method (i.e this.apply), in this case
        <code>jsonFormat2</code> but for other arities, change the number. You could also supply a
        more explicit version of this JsonFormat[RECORD] which you may need to do for more customized
        behavior. Take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/spray/spray-json">Spray JSON</a>
        documentation for more options on providing a JsonFormat.
    </p>
    <p>
        Of course, all of this is a minimal example and a real implementation will probably have a lot
        more code in the Savables, but the point is that this code is only written once and will be
        available to any companion object that extends the SavableN class, meaning you can pack a lot
        of useful behavior into a single line definition.
    </p>
    <p>
        Speaking of single line definitions, let's take a look at how we can use these Savables.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Using the Savables</h2>
    <p>
        Now take a look at
        <a href="#code/src/main/scala/com/example/save/ExampleDomainObjects.scala"
           class="shortcut">ExampleDomainObjects.scala</a>. Here you will see a number of
        definitions like this:
        <pre><code>
case class Dog(name: String, age: Int, weight: Float)
object Dog extends Savable3[String, Int, Float, Dog]
        </code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        The first line is the definition of a pure case class, one that has fields for name, age
        and weight of a dog, types String, Int and Float respectively. There is nothing special
        about this definition other than that we have made it a case class (primarily so it is a
        <code>Product</code> and has <code>apply</code> and <code>unapply</code> methods generated
        for us in the companion object
    </p>
    <p>
        The next line is the definition of our companion object for Dog. The resulting companion
        object will still have <code>apply</code> and <code>unapply</code> methods generated for us, and will still have
        the <code>Product</code> trait supported, but we are also going to include all of our Savable
        logic as well, by extending the <code>Savable3</code> abstract class as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>Savable3</code> takes 4 type parameters. The first three <em>must</em> match the types
        of the fields in the case class (i.e. <code>String, Int</code> and <code>Float</code> and the
        last must be the type we are defining the Savable for (i.e. <code>Dog</code>). This is a bit of
        boilerplate, but it's not much (not for everything we get) and the compiler will ensure you get
        it right. Try changing the Int to a Double for example, to see what the compiler says, then
        change it back to get everything compiling again.
    </p>
    <p>
        This one line of code makes our Dog case class a Savable thing. It does mean that we have some
        concept of Savable in our domain objects now, so they are no longer completely pure, but as we will
        see in a minute, Savable itself is pretty general and may have alternative implementations, e.g.
        XML instead of JSON, if we decide we want to switch the storage formats.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are really worried about keeping the domain object pure, then don't supply the Savable
        definition in the companion object but just put it somewhere else that the compiler can find it
        implicitly. However, if you aren't too worried about the domain object declaring itself to be
        <code>Savable</code> then this is about the minimum of boilerplate code that you can get short of
        using macros to generate the companions.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>See Dog Run! Run Dog, Run!</h2>
    <p>
        Enough of all this theory! Does it work or doesn't it?
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="#code/src/main/scala/com/example/save/Demo.scala"
        class="shortcut">The Demo App</a> which creates a Dog, Person and Fruit, and then uses the
        <code>StringSaver.saveToString</code> method to make a string out of it and print it to the
        console. We will look at <code>saveToString</code> in a moment, but for now, click on Run over
        on the left side of the activator window, and hit the Start button.
    </p>
    <p>
        You should see three lines of JSON created in the output for the run. It works!
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's take a look at that <a href="#code/src/main/scala/com/example/save/StringSaver.scala"
        class="shortcut">StringSaver.saveToString</a> definition. It's pretty simple:
    </p>
    <p>
        <pre><code>
def saveToString[S <: Product : Savable](item: S): String =
  implicitly[Savable[S]].saveToString(item)
        </code></pre>
    Remember that in order to be <code>Savable</code>, a type has to implement at least
    <code>Product</code></code> and this bound must be captured here or it won't compile
    (of course we could have implemented <code>Savable</code> without the <code>Product</code>
    bound, but it would have been less cool then). Other than that, the method is very straightforward:
    it will take any type S that is a Product and has a Savable implicit type class supplied for it.
    The implicit is then looked up (using <code>implicitly</code> and used to call the <code>saveToString</code>
    method on <code>Savable</code> to do the actual work.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Switching the Savable Implementation</h2>
    <p>
        Now comes the real payoff (well, if single line serialization to JSON definitions were not enough).
        What about if we want to switch the format from JSON to something else, say XML?
    </p>
    <p>
        Take a look at
        <a href="#code/src/main/scala/com/example/save/xml/Savable.scala"
           class="shortcut">Savable in the xml package</a> to see an alternative implementation of
        <code>Savable</code>, this one targeting XML strings instead of JSON.
        Ponder the code for a while and notice some of the differences. This is a quick and dirty example
        and not intended to be useful XML serialization (which would no doubt be a lot more intricate
        and cover more of the corner cases).
    </p>
    <p>
        You will notice that the SavableN definitions don't really
        add any value, they are provided for API compatibility with the JSON versions, and don't
        improve on the implementation of Savable in any way for XML. Also, there is a limitation in the
        XML implementation compared to the JSON one. In the JSON one, fields can be any valid JSON-able
        field themselves, but the XML one just assumes that any field will be represented by its toString
        method. The exercise of making a more flexible and complete type class implementation for XML is
        left to you, and if you really want to understand type class implementations better I heartily
        recommend you try it out.
    </p>
    <p>
        To switch to the xml implementation, you need to make changes in a couple of the source files:
    </p>
    <p>
        In <a href="#code/src/main/scala/com/example/save/ExampleDomainObjects.scala"
              class="shortcut">Savable in the xml package</a> comment out the three import lines:
        <pre><code>
import com.example.save.json._
import spray.json._
import DefaultJsonProtocol._
        </code></pre>
        and uncomment the line:
    <pre><code>
import com.example.save.xml._
    </code></pre>
    this will activate the xml type classes for Savable instead of the JSON ones. You will also need to
    edit <a href="#code/src/main/scala/com/example/save/StringSaver.scala"
            class="shortcut">StringSaver</a> to comment out the line:
    <pre><code>
import com.example.save.json._
    </code></pre>
    and uncomment the line
    <pre><code>
import com.example.save.xml._
    </code></pre>
    and then run the app again, you should see XML output instead of JSON output now.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Suggested Exercises</h2>
    <p>
        To get more comfortable with type classes, especially the implementation of them, some of the
        following exercises may be of interest.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Add an implementation of Savable5 in both
            <a href="#code/src/main/scala/com/example/save/json/Savable.scala" class="shortcut">JSON
                Savable</a> and
            <a href="#code/src/main/scala/com/example/save/xml/Savable.scala" class="shortcut">XML
                Savable</a> files using the one of the other SavableNs as an example.
        </li>
        <li>
            Using that new Savable5, create a case class that has arity 5, maybe something like this:
            <pre><code>case class Planet(name: String, pos: Int, color: String, mass: Double, yearLength: Double</code></pre>
            and define the corresponding Savable companion type class for it in
            <a href="#code/src/main/scala/com/example/save/ExampleDomainObjects.scala"
               class="shortcut">Example Domain Objects</a> files using the one of the other SavableNs
            as an example.
        </li>
        <li>
            Output an instance of that new case class in the
            <a href="#code/src/main/scala/com/example/save/Demo.scala" class="shortcut">Demo App</a>
            to make sure it works. Also switch between JSON and XML to make sure it works in both.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you are feeling really keen, improve the XML Savable to require that all type parameters
            in the SavableN classes also have an XML Savable defined for them. After doing this, you will
            need to provide type class definitions for
            <code>Savable[String], Savable[Double], Savable[Int]</code> and <code>Savable[Float]</code>
            in order to get it to compile now. If you understand why, great, if not, go back and read
            the section on implicit context again to grok it. Try out your new implementation on some
            nested Savables in both JSON and XML to check that they now work as expected.
        </li>
