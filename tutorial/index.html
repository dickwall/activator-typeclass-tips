    <h2>Type Classes in Scala</h2>
    <p>
        This tutorial contains a few samples that details how type classes might be useful
        in Scala, as well as some tricks and tips you might not have seen before.
    </p>

    <p>
        Type classes are a particularly useful abstraction in languages that have mechanisms
        to support them. They are a way of adding behavior to standard data classes (like
        case class domain objects and collections, for example) without needing to alter
        those classes directly, instead implicitly (in Scala at least) providing definitions
        of a type class for the type you want to add the behavior to. This is sometimes called
        ad-hoc polymorphism and more detail on the theory can be found
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_class">on wikipedia</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are many good libraries already available for Scala that take advantage of
        type classes for this kind of usage. For example, the
        <a href="http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.1.1/ScalaJsonCombinators">Play
            Framework's own JSON support</a> makes use of type classes like Format, Reads and Writes
        to make it easy to convert to and from JSON. The real advantage of type-classes over
        more traditional approaches to this problem like reflection is that more issues (like
        missing conversions, for example) can be detected by the compiler rather than just
        resulting in errors at runtime.
    </p>

    <p>
        For these examples, we will be using <a href="https://github.com/spray/spray-json">Spray's
        JSON library</a> rather than the Play Framework's
        mainly because the Spray JSON library is smaller and written very clearly, with only
        one purpose in mind - to convert items to and from JSON with a minimum of effort.
        If you are already using Play on a project then the tips and tricks demonstrated here
        can easily be adapted. There is also an alternative implementation which demonstrates a
        simple (and limited) example of targeting XML rather than JSON for the output as well.

    <p>Let's take a look at the code, move to the next page to continue the tutorial.</p>

    <h2>JSON Savable Type Class</h2>
    <p>
        Let's look at a type class definition, starting with the
        <a href="#code/src/main/scala/com/example/save/json/Savable.scala" class="shortcut">JSON
            Savable</a> first.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <code>Savable</code> defined in the json package is the definition of something that when provided,
        will give a String output for a given item input, in this case we will implement the
        string output to provide JSON for the item. First let's look at the <code>Savable</code>
        class at the top of this file.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <code>Savable</code> class is parameterized with a single generic type. This is part of
        the nature of a type class - it only makes sense to have one defined with a type parameter
        because when you extend it or otherwise implement it, you want to do so for a specific type
        so that it provides the extra functionality for that type.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <pre><code>abstract class Savable[RECORD <: Product : ClassManifest]</code></pre> definition has
        a fair amount going on in the type department so let's pull it apart. The first thing is that
        the generic is called <code>RECORD</code>. I used a longer name to make things clearer, but
        it's quite common to see individual letters used to represent type parameters (I think because
        programmers are lazy by nature :-) ).
    </p>
    <p>
        <pre><code>RECORD <: Product</code></pre> means that the RECORD parameter is bound to extend
        <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/#scala.Product">Product</a>. Bound in this
        case means that the Scala compiler enforces this constraint, and it means that you know
        any item of type RECORD will provide the methods defined on Product. Product is a
        trait that is mixed in to a number of Scala classes and implementation including Tuples
        and case classes, and it allows certain operations on the data inside those classes.
